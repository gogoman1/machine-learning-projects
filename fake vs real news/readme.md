The data used in this model is from kaggle, Here is the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stevenpeutz/misinformation-fake-news-text-dataset-79k
Stemming the data in the model took me around 150 mins, thats why after processing it i saved it.
In the fake_news_preiction_model.ipynb  we can paste any news to determine wheather it is true of false as we run it
